To replicate the analysis and generate visualizations using IBM Cognos:

1) Log in to your IBM Cognos account or platform, ensuring you have the necessary permissions to create and replicate analyses.
2) Connect to your data source. This can be a database, data warehouse, or any other supported data repository.
3) Start by creating a new report or analysis that you want to replicate.
4) Select the data you want to analyze. You can choose specific tables, columns, and apply filters as needed.
5) Use the query builder to define the structure of your analysis. This involves selecting dimensions, measures, and any calculated fields.
6) Apply data modeling techniques like aggregation, filtering, sorting, and grouping to shape your data.
7) Choose the type of visualization you want to create (e.g., charts, graphs, tables) and select the appropriate visualization tools in IBM Cognos.
8) Customize the visualizations by modifying colors, labels, titles, and any other relevant formatting options.
9) Add interactivity features like drill-through, filtering, and parameterized reports to make the analysis more dynamic.
10) Arrange your visualizations on the report canvas in a way that tells a coherent story or conveys the intended message.
11) Save your report or analysis, and specify who has access to it.

    
To replicate the Python Code:

1) Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can use the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository:

   git clone <repository_url>

2) Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

   cd <repository_directory>

3) Open the README file in a text editor or in a Markdown viewer to find the Python Jupyter code you want to replicate. README files typically contain documentation and code examples. Look for sections or code blocks related to Jupyter notebooks.
4) Open your Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab) or start a Jupyter server. You can do this by running:

   jupyter notebook

5) Create a new Jupyter notebook within your Jupyter environment.
6) Copy the Python code and paste it into your Jupyter notebook's code cells. Ensure that you maintain proper code formatting.Revise the dataset file path to align with your specific dataset directory.
7) Execute the Jupyter notebook cells one by one to replicate the code's functionality. Ensure that the code runs without errors and produces the expected output.
8) Save your replicated Jupyter notebook with an appropriate name and in the relevant directory within the repository.
9) Use Git to commit your changes and push them to the repository. This will update the repository with your replicated Jupyter notebook.

   git add .
   git commit -m "Replicated Jupyter code"
   git push

10) If you have cloned a repository you don't have write access to, you can fork the repository, make your changes in your fork, and then create a pull request to contribute your replicated code back to the original repository.
11) If you want to contribute to the original repository, consider submitting a pull request to update the README file with a link to your replicated Jupyter notebook or improved code.
